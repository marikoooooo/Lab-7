                    <h1 class="mt-4">About me</h1>
                    <!--tool set, education, personal statement like vision and stuff-->
                    <h2>My Vision</h2>
                    <p>Everyday, we walk past or come across at least 1 bad design. I want to help in decreasing the bad designs that stick out, so 
                        people don't have to just <em>"deal with it"</em>.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Hobbies and interests</h2>
                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>I love history, especially ancient history. It inspires me to create, and seeing how far humanity has come makes me feel 
                        like it is a blessing to be alive in this time where we have everything. Looking at things that have been excavated from 
                        back then, it shows that humans have always been creating for issues.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <p>
                        I am a fan of listening to music and playing music on guitar, recently I have picked up the ukulele as well. I love Oqtay AÄŸayev's 
                        music especially, there is something very nice about old music and how the quality isn't perfect on streaming websites due to 
                        the lack of proper recording equipment back then.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Fiber arts</h3>
                    <p>Ever since I was a child, I loved creating with yarn. Knitting, crochet, and now Tunisian crochet, I have learnt 
                        a lot of techniques and I want to keep learning. My favourite things to make are clothing or bags, as I can put in as much 
                        customization as I want into them.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Tools I use</h2>
                    <h3>Adobe softwares</h3>
                    <p>In the past year or so, I have learnt how to use Adobe InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop. I think I am still a beginner at using 
                        the softwares but I am able to produce products out of it.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Github</h3>
                    <p>Also a recent skill, I am learning how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This portfolio is the result of using this tool, and a lot of
                     hard work.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Freeform</h3>
                    <p>Freeform is an Apple software, I have been using it recently to brainstorm, create wireframes, and ideate in general. The app lets you use 
                        the Apple Pencil to draw, and add text or shapes as well. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>My Education</h2>
                    <p>I have graduated high school with an IB Diploma along with a high school diploma, and I am pursuing a UX degree at Wilfrid Laurier University.</p>

                    <h1 class="mt-4">My work</h1>
                    <!--showcasing past UX work (sitemap and wireframes from 205, app from 103, stuff from Laine's class)-->
                    <h2>Website wireframes</h2>
                    <p>This was a task for a class where I had to re-design a website that was badly made. I had made wireframes on Freeform, these are a few examples
                        from the task:

                    <img src="ContactPageWireframe.png" alt="Wireframe of the contact us page" style="width:30em">
                    <h2>UXstify app</h2>
                    <p>The UXstify app was a group project for one of my classes. The app works like a social media app, but to "match" UX designers both professional and 
                        beginners alike with companies that are hiring UX designers so they can get jobs. The screenshots are just few key pages of the app, it was very 
                        fun to work on this since the final product that came in was fully interactive and was made using Canva and Google Slides.
                    </p>

                    <img src="UXstify3.png" alt="UXstify matching with company page">
                    <h2>Festival posters</h2>
                    <p>One of my personal favourites, these were from a task where I had to make 30 different posters for a hypothetical festival. These were made in Adobe
                         Illustrator.
                    </p>
                    <img src="BobbiBrown1.png" alt="First example" style="width:20em">

                    <img src="BobbiBrown3.png" alt="Third example" style="width:20em">
                    <h2>Website mockup</h2>
                    <p>Lastly, this was also another group project from class. This is a landing page mockup for a hypothetical artist, "Lawrence Lawrence". It was fun to 
                        add the website elements. This was made using InDesign.
